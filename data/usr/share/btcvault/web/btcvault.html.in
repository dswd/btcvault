<h1>BTC Vault</h1>

<h2>Features</h2>
BTC Vault is based on Slax and thus contains a full Linux installation including the KDE desktop
environment and the Firefox webbrowser.<br/>
Also, BTC Vault includes the <a href="electrum.html">Electrum bitcoin client</a> and the 
<a href="multibit.html">MultiBit bitcoin client</a> that you can use to manage your coins.<br/>
Some additional modifications include:
<ul>
  <li>All Electrum wallets (<tt>electrum.dat</tt> files) will open with Electrum.</li>
  <li>You can create new wallets by using the action from the folder context menu or the desktop
      icon.</li>
  <li>You can create encrypted 7zip archives by using the action from the file context menu.</li>
  <li>Firefox supports the <tt>bitcoin:</tt> url-scheme.</li>
  <li>Links on the desktop lead to Blockchain.org and local copies of Brainwallet.org and Bitaddress.org.</li>
  <li>Links on the desktop and the panel lead to the home directory.</li>
  <li>Populated the keyboard chooser in the panel with German, French and Spanish layouts.</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use BTC Vault to create a safe wallet and store it on a dedicated USB stick. Print out the
      seed and store that in a safe location.</li>
  <li>Create a read-only wallet to check your balance on your normal computer as described in the
      section <a href="electrum.html">Electrum</a>.</li>
  <li>Only start up BTC Vault and open your wallet when you want to spend some coins.</li>
  <li>If you want to, create a second wallet containing only a small amount of coins (that you can
      risk losing) on your normal computer for small transactions.</li>
</ul>
